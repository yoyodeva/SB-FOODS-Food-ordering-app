SB FOODS is a comprehensive food ordering application designed to streamline the process of browsing a restaurant's menu, adding items to a cart, and placing orders with ease. The frontend is built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and interactive user interface. Users can dynamically view the menu, with each item displaying details such as price, description, and images. JavaScript handles essential functionalities like fetching menu data from the backend using API calls, updating the cart in real-time, and calculating the total cost. On the backend, the app is powered by Node.js and Express, which manage API endpoints and handle the business logic. MongoDB serves as the database to store menu data, customer orders, and other relevant information. The integration between the frontend and backend allows for seamless data flow, ensuring that the menu updates dynamically and that orders are processed efficiently. Additionally, SB FOODS has scalability in mind, with room for enhancements such as user authentication, order history tracking, and integration with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal. The app also offers potential for an admin panel where restaurant owners can manage menu items, track orders, and gain business insights. Designed to offer a smooth user experience, SB FOODS can cater to a wide range of user needs while maintaining flexibility for future growth and feature expansion.
